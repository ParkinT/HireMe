#### SAIC/Leidos
##### JMPS IVV&E Detailed Job Description

As an active member of the IVV&E in Orlando:

 * Developing Automated Test scripts for JMPS versions/components/MPE
 * Compile test data
 * Validate and verify test data
 * Verify and report JMPS (and JMPS Component) failures and errors 

During the course of my other duties, as I uncover problems or inefficiencies, I  develop software tools and define yet-unidentified processes to address these problems. 

As the primary proponent and loudest voice for improvement I initiate new tools and processes that aid in the sharing of our global knowledge (and collective experience) in Automated Testing for the US Air Force JMPS Enterprise.

This is most often accomplished by spearheading initiatives such as an internal Knowledge-base and WIKI for the Orlando SIL and greater IVV&E.

Within the scope of the SEIC contract for the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), I develop training curricula to provide technical training to Software Developers from our allied countries using JMPS.
This includes research to determine which of the features/functions/operations within the JMPS Enterprise are most appropriate or most requested by these Foreign Military customers. 

Within the scope of the SEIC contract for the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS);
Using the Curricula I created as a guide, I define Topics - with Topic Learning Objectives - that cumulatively meet the defined Course Learning Objectives.
This is targeted specifically to Software Developers from our allied countries who use JMPS.

This includes research to determine which of the features/functions/operations within the JMPS Enterprise are most appropriate or most requested by these Foreign Military customers.

The final result is intended to supplement and expand the current catalog of courses we have available to deliver. 

As called upon I apply my skills and experience to develop any technical (developer) training for other factions within the US Air Force; and beyond.
This includes a reach to technical details of software outside JMPS and/or the realm of Mission Planning. 

Within the scope of the SEIC contract for the Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS), I also monitor and oversee the process of submittal of all materials I develop to the Foreign Distribution Office (FDO).
This includes tracking the approval and developing ways to streamline the process (by offering incremental changes in our current course material, for example). 

The technology focus in the JMPS enterprise is limited and constrained. My professional development, as a creator of software solutions, requires me to remain abreast of the rapid changes in the realm of software development.
Growth in my technical expertise is crucial and important. I continue to seek out opportunities to learn new technologies and carry those new skills back into the stoic JMPS Enterprise.
