HireMe
======

The 'traditional' way in which we hire and get hired is sorely antiquated.  In addition, the format for a Resume is as old and inflexible as the Fax.

I am a software developer.  I love to write code.  I live, eat and breathe text editor(s) and Source Control.  It simply makes sense that my Resume should exist [in this form](ABOUTME.md).

For the more traditional (read as 'old fashioned') way to review my skills and work history, visit [ThomParkin.com](http://www.thomparkin.com).

If you need an experienced, skilled and highly-creative developer (one who regularly thinks out-of-the-box, like this) don't hesitate to [contact me](mailt:parkin_thom@hotmail.com).
