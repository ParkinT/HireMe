## TIME FOR CHANGE
***

In a career that spans multiple decades I have written and rewritten a Resume dozens of times.  Always the "Format du Jour" is simply a modification of the presentation but in the same form: a 'page' of text, like a sales letter, describing your most valued attributes as an employee and your past experience as a history.

That device - the Resume - is as old and inflexible as the Facsimile Machine.  I find it quite anachronistic each time I use my computer to write up a document that will be ultimately printed on paper describing my skills and experience in using a computer to write something far more useful and impactful (e.g. software applications)!

I am a software developer.  

 * I like solving problems
 * I love writing code
 * I __live for__ opportunities to write code that solves problems

It simply makes sense that my Resume should exist [in a format like this](ABOUTME.md).

If you need an experienced, skilled and highly-creative developer (one who regularly thinks out-of-the-box; but hesitates to use an overworked cliche like 'out-of-the-box') don't hesitate to submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ParkinT/HireMe/pulls) to this repository.
