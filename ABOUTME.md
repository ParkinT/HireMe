## History

I was born in a small town [outside Philadelphia](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=2723+Atlantic+Ave%2C+Bensalem%2C+PA).
I was an only child in a poor household.  It took my parents 30 years plus a survivors benefit to payoff the mortgage on the $12,000 house in which I grew up.

My father was self-educated and an avid reader.  He died at a young age (42) but he was a huge influence on my development and taught me some very important things;

  * A thirst for knowledge and learning
  * A exploratory spirit
  * Early training in Electronics (he was involved in the earliest of unmanned space flight)
  * An appreciation for technical things
  * A strong sense of honor, ethics and responsibility

I was a great student in school, often bullied because I was a nerd long before there was a term for it.

At one point my parents asked my permission to use the money they had been saving for me to attend college because the family was having financial difficulty.  I was school-aged, college appeared far in the future, and there was no way to say no to my parents (whom I deeply respected and dearly loved).

When it was time for me to attend college I was left on my own earnings.  Additionally, I had a grant from the Federal Government and a $500 scholarship from my high school; the teachers had voted me "Most Likely To Succeed".

As a result, I could only afford the local Community College.  But the school I chose had a reputation for it program in Mass Media.  My interest was in Film-making.  This was a time when Video was very new and very expensive; not yet available for consumers.

In college I worked with 1 inch Video Tape (on open reels) in Television Production classes; where I quickly developed a reputation for a creative and innovative, out-of-the-box approach.

During my college career I had two jobs, in the school.  One as a paid lab assistant to the Film Professor, and the other working in the College Audio-Visual department.  With the latter job I was __the first minor ever to hold the responsible position of Nighttime supervisor__ for that department.

In the earliest days of handheld calculators I had a strong interest in programmable calculators.  And when the first consumer computers were available, I had them (Sinclair, Heathkit, Atari).

So I am a life-long, devoted Geek with a true "Hacker" spirit and a passionate thirst to learn more about all things technical.  My early training in reading and learning (to overcome boredom, I would open the Dictionary to a random page and learn a new word) instilled in me an almost innate talent for language.

This includes stellar proof-reading expertise and the ability to quickly spot spelling and grammar errors in any document.  Coupled with my technical acumen, I am a great resource for Peer Review of technical documents.

Continuing my record of innovative thinking, I devised this 'Git centric' resume and I hope you have discovered this particular document (a sort of "Easter Egg") in your exploration of the repository.
