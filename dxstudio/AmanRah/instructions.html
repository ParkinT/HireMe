<div id="instructions"><p>Aman 'Rah is a game of matching.  You must match two tiles that share either a Glyph or Color (or both)
by clicking on one and then the other with the mouse.  The amount of score you receive is related to what type of match you make:
<ul><li>Match Color and Glyph - <em>Maximum</em></li><li>Match only Glyph or only Color</li></ul>
<p>The four tiles across the bottom are called the tray.&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a tile from the tray for a match incurs a penalty to your score.</p>
<p>The other tiles are the board.  Notice they are arranged in a pyramid.
You cannot access a tile unless it is completely uncovered.  It requires skill and careful planning
to successfully match all the tiles on the board.  There is a bonus awarded for clearing the board.
</p>
<p>Can you achieve a high score?</p>
<p>There are three levels of play (<em>currently the game is locked on the EASY level</em>)
To help ease the challenge you are permitted to UNDO a move.  Press Ctrl-U
If you wish to reset the game (sometimes the setup of tiles is simply bad) use Ctrl-R.
Currently there is no penalty for a reset.  But this option is not available beyond the EASY level.</p>
<p>Press ESCape to exit the game as store your High Score.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p><p style="padding:1em 0.5em; color:#FFCC00; background-color:#663333;">Aman 'Rah was my first project using <a href="http://www.dxstudio.com" title="DXStudio multimedia development system" target="_blank">DXStudio</a>.</p>
